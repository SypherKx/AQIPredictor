> 🚀 A machine learning project to predict **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using historical environmental data.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict air quality levels based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentration.  

The notebook walks through:  
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Training (Multiple ML models)  
- Evaluation & Visualization
