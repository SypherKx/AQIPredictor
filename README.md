Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Facebook Prophet

This project forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using time series analysis with Facebook's Prophet library. The goal is to predict future air quality based on historical data, which can be crucial for environmental monitoring and public health alerts.

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (AirPredictionFinal.ipynb) and is optimized to run smoothly in Google Colab.

📊 Visuals & Results
Here's a glimpse of the analysis and the forecast generated by the model.

Forecast Plot:
This plot shows the historical data, the predicted future values (yhat), and the uncertainty intervals (yhat_lower, yhat_upper).

Forecast Components:
This plot breaks down the forecast into its underlying components, such as trend and daily seasonality.

💾 Dataset
The project uses the Air Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device.

File: AirQualityUCI.csv

🚀 Getting Started & Installation
You can easily run this project in Google Colab without any local setup.

How to Run in Google Colab
Open the Notebook in Colab:
Click the button below to open the AirPredictionFinal.ipynb file directly in Google Colab.

Upload the Dataset:

In the Colab notebook, locate the file browser on the left-hand side.

Click the "Upload to session storage" button.

Select and upload the AirQualityUCI.csv file.

Run the Cells:

Once the dataset is uploaded, you can run the notebook cells sequentially.

Go to the menu and click Runtime > Run all.

The notebook will handle the necessary library installations (like Prophet), data cleaning, model training, and forecasting.

📖 Usage
The notebook is structured to be self-explanatory. It starts with data loading and preprocessing, where missing values (marked as -200) are handled. It then formats the data for Prophet, trains the model, and generates a forecast for the next 365 hours. The final cells visualize the forecast and its components.
